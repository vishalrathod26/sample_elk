# pipeline files
Sample work on logstash pipelines

This directory contains sample work on logstash pipeline files, taking input from different beats and processing logs before ingesting in elasticsearch. 
There are 4 input logstash files, which sort logs and send them for further processing to individual logstash files, where they are ingested in elasticsearch after processing.
